            <h3>Location data (vendor and delivery person):</h3>
            <P>we collects our vendors device’s precise location if they enable us to do so. Click to pick collects this data from the time an order or delivery is requested until it is finished when they open and use the app, including while the app is running in the background, and when it is in vendor shifts working hours (when the vendor is available to pick up passengers). We use this data to enhance the vendors and passengers use of our apps, including to improve pick-up locations, enable safety features, and prevent and detect fraud.
                Click to pick collects vendor location data, and links location data collected during a trip with their order’s account. This enables us to offer services to the order like receipt generation, customer support and vendor support.
                We will never use your location data for the advertising.
